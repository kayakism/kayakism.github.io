      <text>I'm sorry that I don't have an explanation for why God treats good people so poorly in life sometimes. You
        were a mirror at times, and I hoped my affirmations could undo a lifetime of mistreatment by the people who were
        supposed to care for you the most.<br><br>I hope with everything in me that you find happiness and comfort.
        You're a lovely person and a wonderful friend, and anybody would be lucky to know you. Hopefully you'll find
        this out one day and allow that to be your reason for going on, even when it feels easiest to think of yourself
        as lesser than.<br><br>Om du n√•gonsin vill fly kan du alltid komma hit och inte betala skatt i Amerika.
